🌟 Robotics Vision Fundamentals (OpenCV & Python)
This repository contains a collection of fundamental projects and code snippets for learning Robotics Vision and Digital Image Processing using Python and the OpenCV library. These experiments cover core concepts from image manipulation to video processing and feature detection, providing a solid foundation for more advanced robotics and computer vision applications.

🛠 Prerequisites
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

These scripts are designed to be run in an interactive environment like Google Colab (as indicated by the from google.colab import files imports and !pip install commands).

Upload the script to a Colab notebook.

Run the cells. The script will prompt you to upload an image and/or a video file (e.g., download.jpg, video.mp4) to process.

The results will be displayed using Matplotlib plots or cv2_imshow (in the case of video processing).

Feel free to explore, modify the parameters (e.g., kernel sizes, thresholds, rotation angles), and apply the techniques to your own media!
